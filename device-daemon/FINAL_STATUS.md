## Comparison to Existing Solutions

### vs XMRig (Industry Standard)
| Feature | Our System | XMRig |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Single Node Performance | 60-100 H/s | 100-200 H/s |
| P2P Distribution | ‚úÖ Built-in | ‚ùå None |
| Heterogeneous Hardware | ‚úÖ Automatic | ‚ùå Manual |
| Dataset Sharing | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Modular Algorithms | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |
| Code Simplicity | ‚úÖ 1,642 lines | ‚ö†Ô∏è 50,000+ lines |

**Verdict:** We sacrifice 30-40% single-node performance for:
